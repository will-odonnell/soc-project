1.2.2
	- Lots of changes for AM demodulation: a separate main window for AM, noise reduction, 
	  PLL and CW demodulation, changed AM bandpass filter
	- SNR spectrum plot implemented in DRM-mode, which information is used to improve 
	  reception under interference situations
	- Added history plots for SNR/Audio, Delay/Doppler and Frequency/Sample Rate
	- Small improvements and bug fixes

1.1
	- AAC encoder for Dream TX (using faac library)
	- jpg-support for Windows version (using Freeimage library)
	- including Hamlib library for front-end remote control
	- Journaline library
	- Dream init file, storing some settings and window sizes/positions

1.0.6
	- Improved AM demodulation (introduced new window) -> AM, USB, LSB; different filters
	- Stations dialog with update function (using DRM schedule powered by Klaus Schneider www.drm-dx.de)
	- Remote control for different front-ends (e.g., Winradio, AOR7030, Elektor)
	- GUI for DRM transmitter (start with command line flag '-t')
	- MOT Slide Show encoder + lots of fixes for DRM transmitter

1.0
	- New SNR estimation
	- New algorithm for sample rate offset estimation
	- I/O interface indicator

0.9.3
	- SBR support (needs new faad2 library)
	- AM mode  (analog demodulation)
	- MOT Slide Show decoding (DAB)
	- improved log file
	- command line parameters

0.9.2
	- Time synchronization acquisition algorithm improved
	- Channel estimation: wiener filter with adaptation
	- Log file support
	- Improved metric for MLC decoder
	- Improved (sample) frequency offset tracking, better averaging functions
	- Bug fix in Windows sound interface

0.9.1
	Initial version
