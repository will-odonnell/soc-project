The Dream development team today releases Dream version 1.2.2.

Dream is a DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale) software receiver and decoder. 
It is a very complete receiver, featuring compliant decoding of HE AAC v2 
audio streams, journaline decoding, a feature rich statistics section 
providing invaluable information about the streams being received, and automatic 
update of available stations from the web, among several other features.

It also features a limited transmission mode, that uses the FAAC AAC encoder.

Dream is multiplatform (GUI is done on Qt) and has already been tested on Win32 
and Linux.

Changes since version 1.1:

There's not much of a changelog this time. Logging will be better managed in next 
version.

- Lots of changes for AM demodulation: a separate main window for AM, noise 
  reduction, PLL and CW demodulation, changed AM bandpass filter

- SNR spectrum plot implemented in DRM-mode, which information is used to improve 
  reception under interference situations

- Added history plots for SNR/Audio, Delay/Doppler and Frequency/Sample Rate

- Small improvements and bug fixes
