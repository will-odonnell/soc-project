The Design Compiler
---------------------------------------
scripts - The dc_script.tcl file will run design compiler over the design.  The script is hardcoded with the source file directory.  As we change the source files, we will need to modify the source path in the script.

src - Folder contains the source files for DC.  As new RTL is generated from Catapult, we will copy the verilog files here and keep their top-level folder name.

reports - The dc_script file will generate reports in this folder.
